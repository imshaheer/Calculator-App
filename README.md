# Calculator-App
This repository contains the source code of my Sixth semester project "Calculator App" which I developed using Android Studio.This repository contains the source code for a simple calculator app developed using Android Studio. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input two numbers and select the desired operation. The result is displayed in real-time on the screen. The app is built using Java programming language and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It demonstrates the implementation of event handling, user input validation, and performing mathematical calculations in an Android application. This repository serves as a starting point for anyone looking to build a basic calculator app or learn Android app development.

Features:

Addition: Performs addition of two numbers.
Subtraction: Performs subtraction of two numbers.
Multiplication: Performs multiplication of two numbers.
Division: Performs division of two numbers (handles division by zero).
Real-time Result: Displays the result of the operation instantly on the screen.
Input Validation: Validates user input to ensure both numbers are provided.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a clean and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.
Enter the two numbers in the designated input fields.
Select the desired arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
The result of the operation will be displayed in real-time on the screen.
